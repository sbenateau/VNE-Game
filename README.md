# VNE-Game
A serious game for the participants of Vigie-Nature Ã‰cole.

This game aims to develop data literacy for highschool students.

We developed a game using paper cards in order to change the type of human/machine interactions.

The aim of the game is to analyse data. First, check that you have sufficient data, that the spatial cover is large enough and then answer questions like : "Does the type of environment influence the bird populations ?"
